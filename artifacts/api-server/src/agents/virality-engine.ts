You analyze content across multiple dimensions and output actionable scores.
${benchmarks ? `Benchmark data from memory: ${benchmarks}` : ""}

Analyze this content for viral potential:

HOOK (first 2 seconds): "${hook}"
SCRIPT EXCERPT: "${script.slice(0, 500)}"
PLATFORM: ${platform}
EMOTION DATA: Bingeability ${emotionData.bingeabilityScore ?? "unknown"}/100, Replay ${emotionData.replayScore ?? "unknown"}/100, Dopamine spikes: ${emotionData.dopamineSpikes?.length ?? 0}
RETENTION SCORE: ${retentionScore}/100

Score each dimension (0-10) and calculate viral probability (0-100):

1. Hook Strength: Does it stop the scroll in 2 seconds?
2. Emotional Intensity: How strongly does it make people feel?
3. Curiosity Gap: Does it create an irresistible need to keep watching?
4. Replay Potential: Would people watch it more than once?
5. Watch Retention Probability: What % will watch to the end?
6. Shareability: Would people send this to friends?

Predict: viral_probability (0-100), retention_prediction (low/medium/high/very_high)
List 3 strengths, 3 weaknesses, 3 actionable recommendations.
